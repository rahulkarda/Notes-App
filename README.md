My learning was focused on making the use of Web Storage API and to create a simple UI and a smooth UX for the users to create notes in browser itself.


## Optimizations
When I will improve this project, I would start by updating the UI to be responsive for different size of notes and would add the following features -
   1. Marking a note as Important
   2. Separate notes by user & Login system
   3. Sync and host to web server 
              
## Lessons Learned
Seperation of Concerns. Learned how the web storage API works and difference between local storage and session storage.
