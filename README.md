## Notes-App
A simple note taking app made using vanilla JS and Web Storage API to store the notes. User can add their notes with title and description, search for a specific note using the search bar and can delete the note by clicking on the delete note button.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.

[Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.


## Optimizations
When I will improve this project, I would start by updating the UI to be responsive for different size of notes and would add the following features -

      1. Marking a note as Important
      
      2. Separate notes by user & Login system
      
      3. Sync and host to web server 
              
## Lessons Learned
My learning was focused on making the use of Web Storage API and to create a simple UI and a smooth UX for the users to create notes in browser itself.
Seperation of Concerns - separating the application into distinct sections, so each section addresses a separate concern. Learned how the web storage API works and difference between local storage and session storage.
